abstract: The discovery of the association of a short gamma-ray burst (GRB) with gravitational waves from the neutron-star-neutron-star merger GW170817 gave rise to the requirement to localize GRBs in close to real time even with the most sensitive but also data-analysis-wise most complex gamma-ray space telescopes, the Compton telescopes. Here we report on the implementation and testing of a 3D convolution neural network trained to localize the origin of Compton-scattered gamma-rays from GRB’s on the sky. The ultimate goal of this project is the implementation of a neural network for GRB localization in a FPGA aboard the All-Sky-Astrogam satellite.
